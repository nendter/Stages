# Stages

This is a **MacOS** app written in SwiftUI that renders multiple webviews, movable and resizable, over one another. 
While doing this the app acts like a PiP frame, staying on top of other windows or even desktops.

I built this to make watching uncut reaction videos in combination with the source material easier, but the applications are pretty limitless.

### Open ToDos

- The current state actually is more rigid because I got fed up with Swift ( :D ), but i plan on making the configuration an extendable list instead of a fixed amount of frames
- As mentioned at the top this currently only runs on MacOS and I'd really like for it to work on IOS too, but the IOS WKWebView is much less powerful and restricts quiet a lot in this sort of setup.
